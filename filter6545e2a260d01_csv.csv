Workers could fire their boss. Any politician could be removed from office. All important issues were decided by simple voting. Important decisions were made by the entire team. The working class ruled the country. But in the USA, the country is run by a few of the richest families and they don’t care about the people. There were no homeless people in the USSR. The state provided an apartment to every person in need. Today there are a lot of lies being told about the USSR. In fact, it was the best state for a person.

The status quo is removing these mindless psychopaths and sociopaths replacing them with feeling high emotional intelligence people in their place. People that care about their staffs development and growth even if it's detrimental to their own direct needs in the short term. What's happening is that there is departmental ""mentality"" cohesion is developing and a skill standard that outshines the rest of the business. Making it a place people want to be, not have to be and a team focus that makes real and meaningful change in their organisations. It's simple; treat others like humans and give respect to get respect and watch the results explode into positive outcomes. It's literally common sense education.

Any workplace can adopt this but the psychopaths and sociopaths don't want that. It's up to educators to break the rules to make things right now!! And going with the stupid left agenda is not doing that at all!! Be a maveric and do it quietly. We can force change but we need to do it smarter not harder now.

Civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. 

Conservation of energy says nothing about energy distribution. With this principe only, the heat in a pair of  similar medium temperature thermal energy reservoirs can be shifted at no cost to become held in a hot reservoir, cold reservoir pair. This can be done if micro volumes with a natural range of temperature can be deterministically routed in normal time to become sorted out. 

Diversity, time, and energy are different atributes. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. 

The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's amperes and volts 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are  practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the   exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)    equlibrium thickness of the depletion region. After all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 

Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell's Demons or Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

Ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. It is an old paradigm.  

If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. 
Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. 

I filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

As a schoolchild in the 80s & 90s, I was intelligent and a voracious reader, something I picked up from my mum, not school. I had no interest in school and applied minimal effort, only going on to higher education  in my 30s.
I found university pretty dull as well. In fact, rather than learning 'things', I found it to be more geared towards repetitive processes and basically just paraphrasing information in the papers you submit. 
I've learned far more on my own through reading, watching alternative media, and travelling than I ever did in a traditional education establishment.

Cities are just controlled areas that are overpopulated. City ppl are also the most easy to be controlled I mean just look at the inflation rate and egg prices. It won’t get better because what big company’s did is that they previously lowered food prices for decades and sold food at low prices so more ppl buy them. Now that everyone is dependent on them and they have no way of growing their own foods they just doubled the prices and higher and nobody can do anything about that. They have all the control over the ppl and once society collapses which it prolly will in the next decade or 2 we’ll see a lot of ppl suffer the consequence’s. Masculine men fight back and that’s what the governments don’t want which is why lgbt got so huge the past few years. In history Woman Never fought and sacrificed anything and so did feminine men.

,162-52,07wrxtr1,"2023-10-17 20:23:30",0,no,no,"@The monster Within Possibly - however - if you just go kickback and observe in any grocery or department store - look at how women are now the leaders of the household.  Look at the ""dads"" - most of them are beholden to their womans leadership and parenting style.  There are few ""dads"" that are actually a firm leadership role within households.  I see this nearly everywhere I go...kids out of control, mom using her mouth instead of actually grabbing the kid and their attention that there can/will be consequences.  

The fact is that too many ""parents"" are MORE concerned about being ""besties"" with their kids - rather than preparing their kids for the ""real"" world where they can/will be taken advantage of by corporations and gov't.  How?  Why?  because they don't understand BOUNDARIES -  Boys who later become ""adults"" don't under stand WHEN you physically fight, when you walk away, when you have words then walk away, when you should be silent, and when you lawyer up.   This is what only ""real"" old school fathers could teach - while I'm not a ""bigly"" or ""YUGE"" Jordan Peterson fan - before he went psychotic - he has a good one about what the key role of fathers is - it happens when boys are younger and you're play wrestling - when / where the line between play and fighting/pain is.  While the example sounds ""stupid"" or ""cool story bro"" to you - this is what adult ""men"" are lacking today.  

This is WHY you have guys going out wanting to be remembered in a bad way because they did not have the skills in their tool box to understand that bullying in school is done by weak people and that it happens to nearly everyone.  Instead - if they side with MOMMY - then they begin to emotionally internalize the abuse and it builds up and THEN they lash out and do very bad things.  This is why you hear in the news:  ""...he seemed like a quiet normal kid..was always on time...got decent grades...was never in trouble... we had no idea....""  <--- Because kids like that don't know HOW to deal with being bullied.  This happens in the workplace and in the home in poorly chosen relationships where even women can become abusive of men - this is WHY men ""just snap"" - because they don't have the tools to deal or they don't understand which tool to use and when and how to avoid needlessly escalating daily pokes.

The main issue here is that it cannot be ""summed up"" in a quick headline - and the corporate news media and a lot of ""dude bros"" out there also subscribe to the whole ""they should JUST man up"" attitude.  You have to understand that many people have been slowly hurt over a long time period and this is why they become beholden, vulnerable, or aqueous to letting others trample all over them.

My advice is to just start doing more observation of how men behave around you.  Watch how some kids are very well behaved in family settings vs. other kids that are far from that. Watch how some fathers intervene and how some let the mother do everything.   Over a long time period you'll see some differences.  Mainly where I see them living in a tourist town is that people come here from all over the world - So I get to observe families from Germany, China, Japan, etc - and how their fathers and kids interact vs. your typical passive Laisez faire attitude of most ""american"" present day father roles - where they ONLY intervene if things are out of hand - never preventing things from getting to htat point.

The other major issue here is that this is hard to measure - it's subtle - and it often manifests in completely different ways for different families and kids - so it's never ""all kids who..... end up ....."".  I never said ""all.""  Absolutes won't work.  Sure - there ARE brilliant kids that come out of 8 foster homes and start a business and become stupid rich and understand how to become strong leaders and have zero shortage of women after them.    But - that's the exception. 

Finally - I'm not your ""buddy.""  Anyone can put Zero effort into a reply.  You could have said something more polite like:  ""Not from my experience...""   

I think we can both agree that there is room for improvement in family structures and with our current divorce rates anywhere from 28-60% depending upon how you wish to interpret the stats = there are a ton of boys who lack fathers.  We're 3 generations post WWII and the whole ""free love"" 60's bs..  Are things getting better or worse for families?   

When you arrive at work - think about why HR says things like: ""We're LIKE family.""  Do you believe that's a benign statement?  When did it go from ""teamwork makes the dream work"" to ""We're like FAMILY"" ?   Think about it. Who benefits from the breakup of families.    I'll give you a hint buddy:  Daddy Gvmt and Cor p Mericuh.    

So if you're either entity - and you wanted greater market share or just more power - would you be for or against intact families with fathers?",UCDKhVdQcWUUEodDeRtusCrg,UgwSIPBdqXL1N8-YMRB4AaABAg.9vpl7INiX-E9vzLxgehKba,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgwSIPBdqXL1N8-YMRB4AaABAg.9vpl7INiX-E9vzLxgehKba

Like wake up. Decades of trauma and violence caused to the LGBTQ+ community will have been exacerbated by a queer-phobic education system that encouraged hate.

By schools now celebrating queerness, it is a positive (not a negative).

Spending instructional time teaching any specific ideology in the classroom(including my own) takes away from learning the subject itself. Those that disagree with this ideology(whether it’s woke or conservative) are massively turned off to the learning process itself. Just as most anyone is turned off to fictional kids movies that get overtly political.  This is the biggest reason why so many students in western countries are are struggling. 

 Schools are supposed to be a neutral place of learning in which the study of a subjects like math and science are elevated beyond any personal biases like politics, religion etc. Instead, that realm of personal biases(at least in western educational systems) was traditionally left to parents and, at the appropriate age to structured student debates.

205,,"The Flash","2023-10-14 05:05:18",0,no,no,"The exploration into the historical and philosophical underpinnings of the modern education system, particularly its roots in the Prussian model, underscores the age-old tension between education as a tool for state control and education as a means of fostering individual growth and creativity. The Prussian model, with its emphasis on obedience and conformity, was undoubtedly effective in achieving state objectives, but at what cost to individual potential and societal progress?

In the context of the American education system, both at the high school and college levels, there's a pressing need to re-evaluate the balance between standardized curricula and individualized learning. While standardization can ensure a baseline quality of education, it can also stifle creativity, critical thinking, and the development of unique talents. A potential solution lies in fostering a more holistic approach to education, one that values not just academic achievement but also emotional intelligence, creativity, and practical skills. This would require a shift from rote memorization to project-based learning, from standardized testing to diverse assessment methods, and from a one-size-fits-all approach to a more tailored educational experience.

Globally, the challenges are even more diverse, given the vast cultural, economic, and political differences between countries. However, the core principle remains: education should empower individuals to reach their full potential and contribute positively to society. In this context, the Finnish education system stands out as a beacon of hope. Renowned for its emphasis on student well-being, teacher autonomy, and a lack of standardized testing, the Finnish model prioritizes deep learning over superficial memorization. But can it be replicated globally? While the principles of the Finnish system are universally appealing, direct transplantation might not be feasible due to cultural, economic, and infrastructural differences. Instead, countries could draw inspiration from Finland, adapting its best practices to their unique contexts.

In conclusion, while the historical roots of our education system provide valuable insights, the future demands a reimagining of how we educate. Whether drawing from the American or Finnish models, or creating a hybrid, the ultimate goal should be an education system that nurtures the holistic development of individuals, preparing them not just for the workforce, but for meaningful, fulfilled lives.",UCBVUHxfNjaqRDy-pRIR4JYg,UgzQP9Yv5PBNHfM9OXd4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgzQP9Yv5PBNHfM9OXd4AaABAg

The present moment is a result of a long chain of cause and effect that we are born into. Because of this, much of who we become, who we meet and our allegiances are determined at the moment of birth. We are a product and circumstance of the environment we are born into.

Meaning - You will find many doctors and lawyers simply playing the role of doctor and lawyer. They know the right words and order in which to say them. They play the part and when given a test they have adapted for, will be able to just about pass.. To all those blind, they see no difference, a doctor is a doctor and a lawyer is a lawyer.. But to those that can see, the truth is known and the cracks are visible. So don't get me wrong - There are specialists that strive in their fields - this is not what we are talking about, we are talking about the people that pass the grade.

My step father was a lawyer. That did not make him an intelligent man. It just made him educated in a specific discipline. I know many doctors through family friends. They are as varied as any individual. I have met many a general practitioner, that I have had cause to doubt both their intelligence, education, and aptitude. I myself am a communications network engineer - I used to work within training and development. I have seen many practitioners rise within the field, by saying the right words in the right combinations, but actually having very little genuine aptitude - This being proven when resulting in massive network failure later down the line.

My point is - Give me a twin with a supposed IQ of 99, and give state education the other twin - I will raise a human seemingly far more generally intelligent, than any state raised child. My point is also; that there has been conscious decisions and choices made within state education around the western world, to either inhibit the individual or to only educate to a degree upon which they are useful to the state, for the professions required by the state.

This fixation on sexuality and gender identity is just a distraction to keep people from seeing the empty shell of an already terrible and destructive education system being drained of its last few drops of blood (profit). College education should be free for all who want it, education should be celebrated and encouraged by the government both federal and state wise. This country could easily provide free college education for anyone who wanted it, the price of colleges is hyper inflated just like medical care, medical equipment and prescription meds it’s all hyper inflated.

290,,Twiddle_things,"2023-10-14 07:40:02",1,no,no,"Ohoho Finland is fucked. If you've (the reader) seen any of my comments you'd know. My previous teacher constantly preached woke ideology and fought with the students and guilt tripped us. Yknow, the special ed ones. The ones who either have actual issues or CPS wanted to shove unneeded medications down (IE me. I still won't forgive social workers for putting 12 year old me on birth control). She's make us watch woke documentaries from Yle (ginormous can of worms) and other places. 99% of our classes consisted of us (me and the two boys) arguing with her or ignoring her on our phones. I'd frequently record her lectures and complain about them with my dad. My favourite experiences were when she said the communists in WW2 were innocent workers oppresses by the capitalists up top and they just wanted rights, when she said Italy's new prime minister is a Mussolini admiring nazi right in front of me, the Italian, and when she was talking about politics and how being vegan will save the earth and is healthy, so I explained how it's unhealthy and destroying their bodies (my dad's childhood friend ended up in a wheelchair), she gets pissed and says it doesn't affect me so why do I care, and I respond with ""my opinion doesn't affect you so why do you care"" and I see her brain malfunction and all she says is ""exactly"". My favourite classes were the ones with different teachers. Believe it or not, there's more to 8th grade than arguing with a morbidly obese can barely fit on a single chair wokie lunatic. She showed us, minors, 🌽 once. When my dad and I complained to the headmaster rexi principal what have you he whined about it being a part of the curriculum so it was ok and delved into technicalities like ""oh there was no wiener shown"". Yeah, a man moaning on top of a moaning woman as she clutches him in bed is a part of an 8th grader's education. In 7th grade (same school) my teacher had this fat fuck smelly assistant come in to teach terveystieto (health information?). She gave us, 12-13 year olds, condoms, told us about her sexual experiences with her husband, told us how to get off, told us why we should, told us about sites like 🌽hub and ended the lecture off with ""sex is all about pleasure and exploring yourself"". I hadn't turned 13 yet.  This was at school. I spent the class headphones on my head drawing on my phone. I got a nasty mark in Wilma, of course. But it was a hell of a lot better hearing what other stuff that p3d0phile had to say. That same school has gender neutral bathrooms. Over all, the worst one I've been to over the years. Here's my personal school ranking because social workers and CPS are incompetent assholes who value politics over the suicidal child:

Viialan Yhtenäiskoulu - worst. Lost of porn and gender politics
Hakalantalon Koulu - had a racist 1st grade teacher, the English teacher bullied me, and my teacher from grades 2-4 also bullied me, humiliated me in front of the class and showed us gay men kissing. To hell with you, Terhi.
Vehkojan Koulu - politically charged, a man is going into the women's locker rooms and competing in our sports, tons of gay and trans shit, but this time no 🌽. And no teachers bully me, so that's a plus.
Ortelan Koulu - best school I've been to so far. Probably locked down. Teachers ignored most of the education system BS and taught us in unique ways. I began to love math and learning because of that place. The teachers were friendly and Lasse genuinely saved my life by reporting my mother to CPS and watching over me whenever I was feeling depressed or forced to go to school sick for the 80 billionth time. Principle was a charisma bomb, too, though I forgot his name. Looked like Vsauce and came to our classes often. The students bullied me a lot but that was sorted out. English teacher sucked just like every one so far, though. There were slight politics, but they are unavoidable in Finland. And there were needles found on campus, but that's because sadly it was located in an area with lots of gangs. Overall best school I've been to. Heard Lasse has retired and has a kid now. Godspeed you magnificent bastard

Anyways that's about it for my incomprehensive rant. Oh, and also, to hell with Raili Haaki. That thing is from hell. Don't move to Finland! Thanks for reading

My points were this:

1. Moon is clearly using generative AI for his scripts and voice recordings. The shift in writing tone has been subtle, but it's there. And he has enough content and AI is good enough to replicate his voice so he doesn't have to record manually.

2. The side effect of this is a massive reduction in quality. He used to post a quality video every few weeks, now he's just pumping clickbait shit out multiple times a week. It's such an old tactic, he's using fearmongering to trigger the part of your brian that responds to fear in order to keep you engaged in his content so he gets ad revenue. Of which he is getting a lot more now because of increased frequency.

But yeah, sure, don't stand for this. Keep being scared of the boogeyman and blaming the system for your shitty life 👍",UCfotlY5v2UKxQREFsumx2LQ,UgzDq46yBtOPYeUjRER4AaABAg.9vrCz5CoTvX9vrNGfjv5oC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgzDq46yBtOPYeUjRER4AaABAg.9vrCz5CoTvX9vrNGfjv5oC

I also never studied before exams; I just did as many problems as I could, on my own, throughout the semester. I would also read material on my own and do problems outside of what was assigned.

People would literally study for an exam off the notes they took in lecture, which is absurd. Notes will always be a disjointed, incomplete mess, and 'good note taking skills' does not change this. Good note taking skills is not taking any notes at all. This also has the added benefit of greatly increasing one's memory capabilities.

Obviously, everyone I told this to never listened and continued to take notes and not read the textbook beforehand, whilst getting low grades on exams. My strategies and tactics are extremely simple and very easy to implement. They just chalked it up to me being naturally more intelligent than them and, thus, they couldn't do it.

The main obstacle is that people lack the confidence to do this; I have full confidence in myself and my abilities; I have no self-doubt.

I never question myself with respect to my decisions and actions; I question everything I learn, and more, beyond that.",UCH3tlful_h159IZ2oVCUZew,UgyDusyvnZSf1Yms_Al4AaABAg.9vrJ3_GPGVP9vu30DkSlOz,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgyDusyvnZSf1Yms_Al4AaABAg.9vrJ3_GPGVP9vu30DkSlOz

619,,Avion,"2023-10-15 03:42:49",33,no,no,"I've been thinking about this quite a bit recently. It's so strange to think about the heavily blurred line between seeing people as an individual vs seeing the mob or as statistics, as you often hear it verbalized. 

Marching bands are initially what got me thinking about this. It's the fact that every one only can see the mob of people and it looks cool from a far, but once you go closer, they are all wearing the same exact makeup and clothes. Obviously the uniforms make everything look organized, but even the makeup, such a little detail which no one from a far can see, is all the same.

Unfortunately this is often how the work place is. (Work place being a broad term.) From the outside it all seems to be beatiful with everyone doing their job to output something that is pleasing, but once you see the people at an individual level, you start to see the cracks and how they live their live as just ""one in the group."" which makes that line between individuals and mobs really really hard to draw. You see that in murder cases alot. 

You often don't see them as individuals because they don't stand out. But if, say, an entrepreneur was killed, that would make the media more often because they stood out in the crowd. And it seems like a ""no, duh,"" but it really is a failure on the school systems, often times, for people's inability to see people as individuals, and that is because, often, there is no individuality to be seen.",UCKaLXsPJ5PoQDjfftDFpKLw,UgyfJ7Hnwu47L2ezBG54AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgyfJ7Hnwu47L2ezBG54AaABAg

What do you think is the reason for that?

,665-3,coconutcore,"2023-10-19 06:30:50",1,no,no,"@Gabriel Jimenez Here it comes:

Language was the one thing that didn’t go smoothly. You need to speak it. And I’m sure you know this, but some teachers don’t. Make them speak. Not write, speak.
I just learned hours ago that it’s also a known thing for my situation to happen. Both gifted people AND people with ADHD are seperately known to perform far better outside the current school system, which is adapted to the average student in all ways except intelligence, in which it’s adapted to the least intelligent, otherwise they’d stay behind. This means gifted people are put into a situation that does nothing for them all day every day, and people with ADHD can’t focus on the way the class is given, resulting on me doubly being bored out of my mind. For most of my life, I thought it was normal that a person only heard 50% of what the teacher said at most, and filled in the rest. I did most of the work at home anyways when the exams came.
The worst thing is, this isn’t necessary. We’re just so dogmatically focused on treating every student the same, that we forget that wether you like it or not, no student is the same, and that ABSOLUTELY MAY NOT EVER BE CHANGED. It’s an absolute, shameful crime that we do this anyway. We hammer people into a box until they break into it and tell them they were always broken, because they needed to be hammered into their box.
So my second advice is to treat every student the way they require. I know you can’t, but you should hold some student’s hand and only touch others’ when they come ask for it. You should motivate some by being enthousiastic about their progress and bry dry and direct with others. You should give them excercises adapted to their shortcomings. You CAN’T, because that’s not how teaching works in a classroom of random people, and people would get jealous. But that is how it should be. So to some extent, treat them differently in as far as you acceptably can, because I can assure you some of your worst students are secretly great, but just taught in the wrong way.
I’m even since this original comment still learning how much I need to unlearn school to be productive. Not the classes, I can’t remember any of that, but the manner of working. That’s messed up. Speaking on the subject of language, I came out of high school being afraid of French, because I failed at learning it for about 10 years in total where I live. I even after I finished, I ended up having a girlfriend whose family spoke French at home, and for 4 years I continued failing to learn it, even though I knew enough of the words. I left that relationship and decided “I’m never speaking French again.” It took only a month or two for me to decide, “okay that’s childish, I’ll never try to LEARN French again. I’ll accept my level of French without shame and just use it in as far as I can.”
One year later, and I’m currently in Paris for college. Yesterday, I had a smooth conversation when buying a tangerine at a market stall. It sounds stupid, but I left smiling in the rain, telling myself I could speak French. Later, when ordering in a restaurant, my classmates were struggling, and after ordering I was told “you speak French pretty well.” Then I bought a book in French and started reading it. I was baffled, because suddenly, I can read French.
I realise that not only was the way I learned to speak French to be afraid of failure, but the way I learned to learn French was to be doubly afraid of failure, because if you say it wrong, the teacher’s disappointed in you again. It’s only when I stopped being afraid that all the things just came out. And it’s only now that I realise that all I needed to learn French was just not to worry and just…do French. Fear of failure is overrated at school. And I failed to do the same with my ex’s family, because I was afraid they’d look at me like my teachers did. …also they spoke way too fast and about things above my paygrade. But yeah. Yesterday I learned to speak French for the first time, because I wasn’t focused on my mistakes like I was at school.
Third advice: when working with your worst students especially, try and see if maybe they’re focusing on their mistakes too much. They need to just speak it wrong, but make themselves be understood.
And another thing, I hate groups. It’s overwhelming, I get anxious in them, I’m ashamed when I make a mistake FAR more. So…I wish I’d been able to learn French 1 on 1 with someone I trusred, even if it was in a classroom with someone who also didn’t know what they were saying and the teacher just walked around and came to give feedback from time to time. We never did that that I can remember, and I’d still have been stuck, but it would have worked much better. I should have done that more with my ex, but I felt so ashamed and less than her when I couldn’t say a thing right that I just said almost nothing. Don’t always make them speak in group. I’m not the only one who builds up that “I can’t do it” voice in their minds from that.

Anyway, as I said, I couldn’t do language in 1 hour on my own. But I did absolutely learn it wrong from the start.",UCvODuxty_6Hy_3pC3mQ7-Aw,Ugwg5C1_E1HlokmdqpJ4AaABAg.9vsnOHWF6s39w20FhZN1AK,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=Ugwg5C1_E1HlokmdqpJ4AaABAg.9vsnOHWF6s39w20FhZN1AK

And I'm not the only one who sees this; so, there is a good chance the student ""identifying as a cat"" was doing the same thing and the comments of the other two students, rather than being a personal attack, were an observation of just how much dissimulated identity is out of touch with reality; an idea which is strongly opposed by modern authorities.

It is mind-boggling that there is this push to legitimize telling lies about what you are. What next? Will it be OK to identify as a ""doctor"" when you don't have a doctorate or identify as a licensed driver when you don't have a driver's license? I sure as Oblivion don't have a pilot's license so, what if I jump on the bandwagon and identify as a ""pilot""?

Though the issue is that rather than teaching kids how to think critically and letting them explore these ideas and think for themselves, they are taught to memorize facts and never any critical manipulation of ideas.  Someone who is taught to critically think and is introduced to both ideas fairly will be unlikely to adopte either completely.  Ideally they will pick the elements that ring true of each of them and form their own ideas based off of their ability to manipulate ideas for themselves.  

Nothing wrong with being exposed to ideas.  There is something wrong with teaching kids that knowledge is absolute and that there is a correct way of thinking about something and there is certainly something wrong with shielding people from ideas just because we think they are ridiculous.  Someone who can think for themselves will be more than capable of saying ""that's a load of BS"" all for themselves.

Political ideas should be explored in the manor of letting children form their own unique ideas and opinions on subjects and not being afraid to share those.

Now I don't usually put it on my resume since I'll be overqualified and often overlooked for the basic 9-5 HS level jobs.

So basically, find your own path and explore all options that are available to you. I may not know what direction you want to head towards in your life nor what options are available but learning all the different paths you can take will definitely make you thrive in life.",UCLwjLgwAM_EDz7fSN38wWzg,UgyHtBbsdmapt-xTMvp4AaABAg.9vu9piVl5e-9wWS1O3-jMK,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgyHtBbsdmapt-xTMvp4AaABAg.9vu9piVl5e-9wWS1O3-jMK

That being said, if my learning and thinking began and ended in school, if the essence of my existence boiled down to what i produced in class and what grades I got, i’d be no different than an automaton worker drone. I think it’s good to be responsible and do what you need to do, but where will it end? Do you learn to learn or learn just to get a number? 

I agree that there’s quite a bit we need to change systematically, but I think it can start merely with people learning to think for themselves, and be scholars in everyday life, not drones in the system. 

I think solutions could be simple as parents helping educate their kids in addition to school, with things like chess, books, engaging games and movies, as well as involving them in many extracurriculars. I think being in an environment of learning and education will naturally give kids to being free minds.  

“I have never let schooling interfere with my education”

I will say, the american education system has a pro in creating a generally much more educated populace than before, when someone being literate was like finding a shiny pokémon. But as the ROI has decreased over time, I think we need to make sure we are encouraging the full development of the mind.

P.S: The quality of a class tends to deviate GREATLY based on the teacher/professor. I’ve been privileged to meet some of the most engaging and enriching teachers that have greatly educated me, and enabled me to learn to think for myself. On the other side of the coin, I’ve also met teachers that just read off slides or talk AT students.",UCAoeoIYkBkYxMWY-a2-9Dpw,Ugx3kyhfMkh4RBzicLV4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=Ugx3kyhfMkh4RBzicLV4AaABAg

All you get instead of unity is division. Tribalism which is one of the most fundamental problems of the human race just gets exacerbated by all of the decisions made by our rulers and the systems they have created and run.

If kids were specialized in one engineering field, or one trade, or law, or commerce starting from the age of 10-12, through private courses and Self-education, by the time they are 16-20 years old, they'd be highly skilled and knowledgeable experts. They would be able to work in their field on a medium level, even if they start at an entry level one. Instead they come out of universities and they can't do anything(if they solely relied on the education system). They have to desperately submit their CVs to 1000 companies, hoping one would hire them and then start actually learning for the first time in their lives.

I have almost two-dozen friends, acquaintances and people I know that didn't go to university, or even before finishing high-school, got engineering jobs paying 2-5x the average salary by the age of 22-23. How? They skipped school as much as possible without getting evicted, while going to private courses and self-educating. And they aren't the exception for a random reason, they are the exception, because they didn't follow the system.
My best friend got a software engineering job after 10th grade(before finishing high school), two more friends got a network engineer job after 1tth grade, another one got a system admin job after 10th grade, two more friends got software engineering jobs straight out of highschool. Another friend got an automotive engineering job 1 year after graduation as he needed to get integrated in Germany. And the list goes on.

What those people have in common is that their parents started specializing them in their fields through private courses and self-education at the age of 8-12 instead of rotting away in school and the second is that by the age of 22-24 they were earning 3-5x the average salary...",UCZh6_q3uzQXkfqldB6iQTow,UgyyL_zE-13-PL93zfh4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgyyL_zE-13-PL93zfh4AaABAg

And that school should be a place to teach standards, to get people ready for typical jobs.  But even if this was the case, the schools completely fail to do this.  Schools used to teach people basic things like how to cook, how to fix things around the house, the systems of government, rules of etiquette, etc.  And they still do teach these things in certain countries.  But in US public schools, we've gotten rid of all these things.  They were phasing them out when I was in school in the 90s.  People just a couple years ahead of me had stuff like home ec and poly sci.  Then when I got to high school, I was told these classes didn't exist anymore.

I could almost overlook school being conditioning for society if the schools actually did condition people correctly.  Teaching people work ethic, focus and general social skills.  But the school system doesn't do this.  They do the exact opposite.  Activist teachers who tell you to fight the man and give up on life.  I had teachers flat out tell my class that workers are ""suckers"" and you should find a way to cheat the system.  So...then why am I sitting in this classroom wasting my time?  Why are you coming in every day to your ""teaching"" job and wasting your time?

Schools should just let kids do what they like the most. I fucking learned way more things in Youtube videos that could be hours  long or even short ones because it sparked my interest than in class and all my years of learning which says a lot. Why should I care about history, science, ect. When the job I'm aiming for doesn't require any knowledge of anything I learned in school. School Will have no use in my life and will only get in my way of what I want to do. I don't want to be a doctor, a scientist, or any other thing that requires the core classes. I want to be someone who does art, 3D animator, and game developer. 

Even though I'm not that old and still don't know what it feels like to struggle in the outside world, it's already hard when school just has to keep kicking me to the ground while I'm already struggling with loss, dealing with trauma, and having trouble about who I want to be. School is nothing more than a piece of shit that wastes most of your life when you can be doing so much more things in life that should be just burned down to the ground. But hey what do I know. I just really hate learning in school. Just let me learn through things I love not random things being shoved down my throat because they think it's going to be important in my life.

And parents don't tend to have the option to home school because they need to both be out working to pay the exorbitant amounts needed to buy/rent and then run a home.
We'd presumably need to make essential goods and services free to all, or at least cheap to the point where even a basic single wage could easily cover the cost and create the freedom and flexibility to learn outside of the system... Or work out how some sort of universal basic income would work to provide the same freedom?

,1036-4,Sean,"2023-10-22 04:01:20",0,no,no,"@Sonja Sophie ""Manipulation"" is an example of loaded language. As a word it carries a very negative and sinister connotation, of course, manipulation often is sinister and exploitative.
I think ""influence"" is a better word (it's in the title) as it let's you think about using it merely as a tool, as it is, without the baggage of those unpleasant connotations.
As such, influence can be either positive or negative, it just depends how you apply it in practice. 

As an example, if I were to persuade you as a friend by saying: ""Sonja, you really ought to stop smoking. Think of the harm its doing to the health of yourself and others around you, how expensive it is too"". This would be me influencing you to do something that I want you to do by manipulating your emotions and making you feel social guilt, it comes from a good place and the end result is a positive one for you, but it would still be as a consequence of me coercing you to do it.
Is this inherently wrong or evil? I'd say no, but it certainly comes close to blurring the line.

To cross that line completely I would have to knowingly induce you to do something that is good for me but bad for you. This would be the key factor in discerning whether influence is good or not and that's when an unfair exchange of value takes place in a win/loss scenario in my favour at your expense vs. a win/win for both of us (loss/loss is also possible, see toxic people). 
As social creatures it is impossible for us to avoid influencing and imposing our will on others as we cannot execute the necessary functions of daily life without doing so. However, being cognizant of this truth does aid in interacting with others in a more positive and healthy way for both (stop yourself from being used too).",UC4j9FtT2wXrSXnOGcScIy0w,UgwditbVuVESAJdNcWN4AaABAg.9vvsyQld2PD9w9TXQpekA3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgwditbVuVESAJdNcWN4AaABAg.9vvsyQld2PD9w9TXQpekA3

1056,,"John Lander","2023-10-16 12:47:41",0,no,no,"Been a fan of this channel for a while, but I don't agree with everything said here. To me, it feels like the arguments used to present some of the conclusions that are drawn in this video vary in quality. For example, direct evidence is used to argue the reality of the factory model in our standard education system.  Historical, social and political trends were discussed as factors that contributed to this model, providing robust evidence for a compelling argument to be made. However, when addressing the drag queens and even sex-ed, I feel like only anecdotal evidence was discussed as proof of some grand conspiracy to indoctrinate kids. I don't feel like these claims are equal in terms of the quality of evidence presented for each of these arguments, but all of these ""conclusions"" are being lumped together to express a larger theme in this video. I suppose I'm commenting because I'm your average basic straight dude who grew up in NYC surrounded by queer people, and never once did I feel ""propagandized"" in school by those around me who were different. In fact, I was happy that perhaps kids who were different than me could maybe feel a bit more comfortable by being allowed to safely question societal norms and explore different parts of their identity without fear of ostracisation. My experience in school showed me that it was okay to accept others' differences, and we can all get along if we relax a little. 
Teaching sex-ed is always going to be weird and uncomfortable, but somebody's gotta do it. Not all kids have parents at home who are there to answer their questions about these sensitive topics. Presenting anecdotal evidence on fringe cases can quickly spiral into larger groups of people being persecuted and judged. The vast majority of people- from drag queens to teachers- are decent human beings who have their hearts in the right place, and aren't out here to radicalize kids. They're doing the best to be as inclusive as possible and accommodate the vast differences in kids present in a school environment. If we're not careful with our words, we will only further divide ourselves and begin to mistrust not just individuals, but entire groups of people.
Anyway, I generally agree with this video (and the sources presented for many of the arguments). but I just wanted to point out what I see as a line between the objective and subjective parts of this particular one.

It's crucial to provide them with age-appropriate and inclusive information to empower them to make safe and informed decisions throughout their lives. Especially in the digital age where young people have increased exposure and potential risks. It is not a form of grooming to give young people information to protect themselves.

Moreover, addressing the complexities of substance use, including nicotine and alcohol, with a more nuanced understanding of addiction is vital. Offering guidance on where to seek help can make a significant difference in their well-being. Again with the digital age these substances are more accessible than ever. There may even be times when a new compound comes onto the market that is legal and becomes illegal later which may enable harder drug use due to the legality grey area around the use of such substances and already forming a process addiction. If certain drugs are to be legalised (or have been effectively legalised with no prosecution) then comprehensive education needs to come first to prevent first use or as harm reduction.

Furthermore, instilling healthy habits related to technology and internet use is essential, given the pervasive role these tools play in their lives. Balancing screen time with other activities is crucial for their overall development and well-being, too often we do not use the tools at our disposal correctly. Additionally, emphasizing the significance of adequate sleep for young people, who are still in the midst of crucial development stages, is a key aspect of their overall health and hormonal balance.",UC-S0cPmNDi8blm4j4wjZIZA,Ugwy9uJiFOAXgmNdLW54AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=Ugwy9uJiFOAXgmNdLW54AaABAg

Maybe in a technologically advanced future (ala Star Trek) where we've advanced so far as to make certain things like food, housing, etc all legitimately free/unlimited.. In that future maybe we can look into alternate ways of living that don't revolve around working and keeping the economy functioning.  Unfortunately, given the stifling nature of the education system as it currently exists, coupled with the ways in which large corporations and Governments prevent the introduction of certain technologies into existence (because they'd destroy the economy), idk if/when any of this will ever be allowed to occur.

I'll probably take people like Elon Musk/Tony Stark to invent things like the Arc reactor or other comparable energy generating tech that will free us from the need to use fossil fuels or so-called ""green"" energy.

So the production of said mindless dribble is also automated. Repurposed, regurgitated content, presented in a cinematic fashion, added background music, a repeated chorus of 'TRUTH!'.

If a directionless, free humanity propels itself to destruction in this way, it's better we stay in controlled environments where our macro patterns may therefore be established and society can be 'predictable'.

But am i the only person who believes his videos when pretraining to the US are very off point and hyper-fixated on this annoying and massively overblown gender & se* ideology drama in schools? 


It feels like he kind hints at the slow corruption of schools with the history and then randomly jumps to colleges being ""WOKE and BAD"" while not digging deep enough (in my opinion) into why public schooling, not colleges (which every student attends unlike college) as the real problem when it comes to stifling creativity and encouraging for-the-lack-of-a-better-term ""sheep"" behavior among people.

The bad pay for teacher and actually good teachers ALWAYS getting unpaid and treated badly for doing their job better and ultimately getting offed better jobs to teach at rich kid schools, the underfunding of school sanitation and staff, the broken and useless curriculums that don't allow any freedom of understanding or deep explanations of the concepts the standards originate from Or there orgin. NOTHING. 


Its like he understands that, but just skips the issues that actually need addressing and keeps defaulting to this retarded and irrelevant college nonsense that only contributes to a fraction of ACTUAL schooling. Its like, ok joe rogan and this Korean chick may have a leg to stand on given the situations the channel describes and their experiences; Fair, but this ideology crap isnt the actual problem. And he presents this issue as if it is THE main problem with western schooling. And it just isn't given how little people can afford to attend or even graduate college.

All in all, its just kind of annoying to watch him dissect these issues. Its like hes on the right track. But fumbles when it comes to what  needs to be fixed to address/fix these issues.

It probably didn't help with my drug use. Or my work ethic. Or my mental health. Or my relationships with others.

Being a free thinker is great, but be prepared to suffer hugely for it. 

Now I've found that the best medicine for me, is to ignore most of my thoughts, and try to live in the moment. If you're dwelling on what's been, and anxious, thinking about what's to come, then you're not really living. Seize the moment. Experience life. And let it happen. 

Also, don't think things into being. If you believe that bad things might happen, then they really might happen. Mindset is not that hard to change. And don't be emotional. Don't react emotionally to anything, if you can avoid it. 

You'll feel so much better. Believing in yourself, is extremely important. Back yourself. Observe. Remain calm. It's really nice to be chill most of the time.",UCaHoyBRK4KUv_sjMkdoTyog,UgzI76KRlo8nCq3fbPJ4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgzI76KRlo8nCq3fbPJ4AaABAg

Schools aren’t just there too teach math, English, other languages, science, history, geography, religion, physical education and responsibility but it also teaches you how to question authority in a healthy way. If you hate the idea of creating sheeple then homeschool is just as dangerous because parents have agendas to that they want to in-still in kids everyone has a a agenda. If schools don’t encourage kids to question things they would not have libraries, you might not like the idea that kids are told to just sit at a desk but isn’t that a part of life at work. I would have to agree it’s not the role of teachers to tell you to think about things that’s the role of parents.

Outside of the USA it's mostly fine to not have a degree when looking for a job, in europe I've seen plenty of jobs here that I would fit in and have been considered without the need to show a pile of paperwork and degrees, whole idea that whatever form of self-education and pursuit of your own knowledge is disregarded by so many companies just shows the scale of the problem, it's one of those cases that if you want sheep you just get sheep, if you want thinkers you get thinkers. 

I started working early on when I was a young teenager repairing computers and later own started my first business at the age of 18, most people don't even consider this as an option the whole idea of not pursuing institutional education and instead learning things on your own and starting a business is an alien concept it seems.",UC_kGXJtr7vZy-yLiduGpzYQ,Ugye0ybnXrQ3yo0Jkft4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=Ugye0ybnXrQ3yo0Jkft4AaABAg

There are necessary activities that are needed to support advanced endeavors. For example, to create new chips, you need a pyramid style work force with a few elite designers supported by an army of operators, testers, and administrators. Imagine if all of these people were not taught skills and to be good workers and rather made to be ""free thinkers"" instead, advanced manufacturing might never even form as we would be stuck with technology that can only be done by a small team.

PragerU is literally propaganda, it's a tool for brainwashing, there isn't any actual facts to be learned from them. 

Given the thumbnail of the video and the subject being discussed, I'm guessing most of the people here in these comments would rather their children be brainwashed by PragerU than ""brainwashed"" by their country's education system, but there's more to learn by sending people to school than having them lied to by PragerU, and that really doesn't carry much weight claiming that kids get brainwashed in schools, because I myself went to several schools, two primaries and a secondary school, only one of them was trying to make me think a certain way, and that was a small Catholic primary school in an isolated village. 

The point of education is to educate, not to force opinions. We take in information and we then decide what our opinion is, if the objective of any place of education was to tell people what to think, instead of letting them form their own opinion, we'd not have so many different beliefs and opinions among students in schools. I went to school with people that had lots of different opinions, one guy called all Irish republicans terrorists when I talked to him about unifying Ireland, when my opinion on them is that only the IRA are terrorists, as they actually commit terrorism. I also went to school with someone who was unironically communist, and you might think that the end goal of any education system is to turn everyone into an accepting, kind and progressive individual who likes to share food with the homeless and hosts a communal farm, but a lot of people thought he was weird and took the piss out of him. Our curriculum in the UK never showed biases, except for the obvious bias against Nazis from the teachers (not so much bias in the textbooks or videos), and that one time a teacher in a year 2 history lesson called Guy Fawkes and his friends ""evil Catholics"", and maybe the curriculum in the Catholic school I went to in Ireland was biased against the UK and biased towards Catholicism, but I still came out of there an atheist and also not racist towards the English.

Most children actually form their opinions based on those of people they're close to, it's how I came to dislike social services and the conservative party of the UK because my parents also don't like them, the conservatives are also generally not smart, they mess up sometimes and make policies with their rich friends in mind, rather out of touch too. A lot of parents with certain feelings towards the LGBT or ""communists"" would prefer that their child be as close to them as possible and homeschool them so they can force their own opinions into the child's head, just the same way they think teachers in schools force opinions into children's heads. Most teachers are just trying to teach, I had a few gay teachers, they didn't have any ulterior motives and didn't tell me to accept them or else I'd be in trouble, and obviously any reasonable and sane person with more than two braincells would be accepting of another person regardless of how different they are, that's not really propaganda so much as it is common sense to just not be a cunt.

Of course, homeschooling is a viable option for children who want to learn something very specific, or if going to school isn't possible. There's a lot of proper sources for educational materials that you can use, that aren't propaganda machines like PragerU. You can also use the internet to fact check the sources you're using, compare them with each other, compare them with other sources, look up forum posts and reviews regarding those sources, and do the same for the sources of the sources. If an educational website that you're using cites where it got all it's information from and has a bunch of certificates and seals of approval, it's probably better than PragerU.

If you have any unsavoury opinions, it's best you don't force them on your children. They need to think for themselves, if the purpose of taking them out of school is to avoid indoctrination, you also should try your best not to indoctrinate them yourself.

On the topic of bullying, while I'm writing this, as the person who posted this comment will also see this, I experienced bullying in school, but it definitely wasn't allowed, just as me punching or slapping bullies wasn't allowed. I had good teachers that actually upheld their duty of care, so whenever I was mocked or verbally abused, the issue was dealt with whenever it was noticed, and if I got angry, I'd be taken away for safety reasons and whoever took me out of the situation would explain to everyone else that they shouldn't be cunts and what they did was wrong. If anyone is letting students get bullied, or letting the bullied students start hurting people, they're bad at their job, you can't pin that on an entire education system.",UCv2PXDTVDF-HJYXxqfrTedg,Ugwa5NHrNAHJe1FIVIx4AaABAg.9w0Wc-a2eYk9wVtgTOwtzS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=Ugwa5NHrNAHJe1FIVIx4AaABAg.9w0Wc-a2eYk9wVtgTOwtzS

Those who don't ask questions stay dumb. 
Getting suspended gives you free time to learn on your own. So the plan is to, based on logic, debate the truthfulness of what is taught when it doesn't seem right. Ignore when you are told to shut up, instead take it as a sign of success and encouragement. With orderly reasoning and a calm voice, double down until you get suspended for being outspoken, not for causing chaos.
In the time gained through suspension read about upcoming topics in class to prepare yourself to challenge them even more effectively.
Also use it to learn about topics which you have a passion for.
Don't just rely on your textbooks,
seek out other literature on the topics ahead, otherwise you will not be able to question why some information is omitted from the textbook.

Never let the system choke out your curiosity and don't stop thinking for yourself!

Caution! Thinking critically for yourself and in debates with others requires you get to know the logical fallacies there are and learning how to avoud them, which is one of the big challenges in the human life. Don't underestimate how stupid you too can be at times!

It’s not my interests. In fact, my interests are the exact opposite of what my government deems “democratic values” nowadays. It’s globo-homo, and I can understand why these other countries hate us. 
I can now see why it’s so easy for these authoritarian nations to convince the majority of heir population that America is the “great Satan”. I think they’re right. I can’t think of anything important that we’re doing to make ourselves seem like we’re NOT the great Satan. 
I think America will soon be wiped of the face of the earth. I hope I’m wrong. I wish we could have another chance, a reprieve to try and repair the damage that’s been done. But it’d take a century to turn things around, and that’s if we started fixing it today. I foresee the total collapse of the US economy and society. And our leaders are so desperate to maintain power that I sincerely believe they’d drive us further into debt, demoralization, and conflict in order to keep us distracted and divided. And if they do that, I believe the rest of the world is going to come together and decide they’ve had enough of us. They already have! It’s only a matter of time before they come together and decide it’s best to put us out of our misery, especially if we’re lashing out at the rest of the world as we spiral to the bottom.
I honestly think we deserve whatever happens to us for allowing ourselves to be overtaken from within by a sick and perverted elite that is just using our wealth and military might to bully the rest of the world. 
I’m fine if they deleted us tomorrow. I hate it here. I don’t have the ability to leave and idk where else I’d go if I could escape. There’s nothing to look forward to, no hope for a better future. In fact, I can only see reasons to dread the future.

Once you know how something works already in a game, like a mod, you can then look at that mods inner workings to see how it operates and build your own skills off of that.

As long as you still write your own custom code and don't steal anything preexisting of course. Nothing wrong with studying off of preexisting works!

I have actually been feeling a bit oppressed in the main school I go to due to the constant bullying, which I even feel even more degraded as they put me in the Special Education hallway of the main school (for one particular class). That specific class has much easier stuff but I actually want things that are challenging, and I wish I could ask for a class change but I can't due to attending two schools at once.

The most fun I ever had was in a private school that my home school paid for when they saw my scores and then saw my grades (basically, I topped everyone, but was failing everything- all thanks to a principal that did actually care). It was also very obvious to me that ""woke"" was just the new term for ""racist.""",UCC7brcEEXLhxtL7lpTW5Aaw,UgyaMJU9hxFmF8CN6Xx4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgyaMJU9hxFmF8CN6Xx4AaABAg

The system has been intentionally poisoned from the beginning. Even medical school for becoming a GP is useless, all they teach you is how to push drugs. Think about it! You don’t go to the doctor for them to ask you what your eating, how much exercise you get, what kind of supplements you take, or how’s your sleep. They ask: what are your symptoms? Then say, “they have a drug for that”. They are taught by the pharma companies to push drugs.
The medical field hasn’t cured anything, only temporarily covered up and masked the symptoms. 
Now I’m not saying doctors and researchers haven’t tried, because they definitely have. And there are definitely ways to cure, but all things good get covered up.

Rockefeller along with other devious players created the education system, the medical system, big pharma and much more. That right there should tell us not to trust any of it. Rockefeller was the one who came up with the propaganda campaign to smear all good holistic doctors names. He’s the one who used to word Quack. If healers and doctors wouldn’t push his big pharma drugs, they were blacklisted. And his plan worked well.

There's only one way to defeat the system, generations of rebellion and a day scheduled for a complete boycott of all of society.

If you're trying to make a point that people will respect, use credible sources, not opinions from a highly controversial show. And this is also a subjective opinion, but starting sex ed that early isn't necessarily a bad thing. Five year olds certainly do not need to know about pornography or how intercourse works (that should be saved for later years) but shutting down and making taboo all mentions of sex and then throwing the child into a world that glorifies it is really confusing and leads to that child making bad decisions. I did a sex ed program in my UU congregation called Our Whole Lives, or O.W.L., and while some of it was about sex, a lot of it focused on general decisions and consent and explained consequences of decisions very well. Plus, there are multiple levels, so you build on your prior lessons as you grow. My instructors were really helpful and made some changes to the program when it didn't quite fit our needs as a group.

It used to be that religions would be the controlling tool of education in the medieval era. Then, after the Enlightenment in Europe, nationalism/patriotism took religion’s place as tool in education. 

This new shift we see nowadays with LGBTQ+ stuff being thrown out in front of kids to “satiate their minds” is just a modern retelling of a very old lie, created to control them and rob them of their identities.
There is no grand LGBTQ+ scheme, frankly governments will just take anything that is the “flavor of the century” to rebrand its slave production machine. 


The university system is there to give normal people hope that they can raise their standards of living. It justifies the rich getting diplomas and high end job effortlessly by telling lower class people that if they didn’t become CEO is because they’re stupid or haven’t worked/studied enough to earn it.
The education system does not “educate”. It PRODUCES inequalities and feeds it to us as “merit-based results”.

What people don’t realize is that teaching university students about gender studies, LGBTQ+ stuff, racial theory, anti-capitalism/imperialism,… essentially separating life in good and bad, is just a straw man to keep what would be the  new critical thinkers occupied with useless issues while the rich and powerful can continue their ACTUAL capitalism/racism/inequality system in their favor.",UCqq6vop0E95x0KfyEyFoAww,UgwmxBLxYyi0HjzDAER4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgwmxBLxYyi0HjzDAER4AaABAg

Around the time they implemented the 'No child left behind' this also made it so only Genius level kids could actually skip grades in most of America, atleast where I was living in New England. Instead each school I attended only covered 1-4 grades, and after the first year I would usually take the highest level class, 3-4 times over and over, instead of letting me just move to the next building.
I took:
 3rd grade math 3 times (multiplication and division)
 8th grade math 3 times (basic Algebra)
 Advanced algebra 5 times
 Basic Calculus 2 times 
This caused my grades to slip and I became a C/D student, usually from doing next to 0% of my homework and minimal to no class participation, but receiving nearly perfect marks on all my tests. In High school I finally had the chance to do AP or actual college level classes with a final test rewarding me College credits. This was a nice change, and I once again received Straight D's in High school, but never failing, despite having to still take some classes again to fulfil some pointless quota. I was usually placed with the same teachers again and again. At the end of the year my highschool Sr. year they ranked us by student, I was literally the lowest ranked student by grades in my class, because I never failed anything and did not have to take summer school to raise/rewrite my grades, To me in my little head I beat the system and achieved my goal. The school never had anyone in recent history of the school that made it their point to get the lowest possible grade in a class but still could pass, which was 65/100. If I didnt get exactly 65 in each of my classes I was disappointed in myself.

when I finally went to college, I was informed week 1 by my guidance-councilor that I should have probably just taken my GED test in my freshman/sophomore year of high school, and once passed just went straight to college. Of course no one told me this till I wasted 3-4+ years of my life. In College I proceeded to take the same math class again just to fulfil the prerequisite of my General studies degree.  However, looking at the syllabus I learned that over 70% of my final grade was from the Final Test, so I raised my hand on the first class, asked if this was true, and didnt show up to the class till the Final Test.  I received a 95% on the test because I didnt feel like answering the written-answer-questions at the end of the test, leaving them blank. 

Math was not the only subject I excelled at, these were just examples. The US / Newengland School public system failed me if this was not apparent. I have NEVER used my degree, I now run my own successful business, and get to travel the world doing what I love.",UCnqHM9oTOnjkxHY9z33YB7Q,Ugxlp5ATu2SAhJMsUxN4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=Ugxlp5ATu2SAhJMsUxN4AaABAg

My only “classmate” was a special needs brother that hated my guts. I wish I could’ve been public schooled in elementary and middle school, then homeschooled in high school. There’s so much I feel like I missed out on. Growing up so poor you’re getting cereal boxes from Grandma didn’t help. I’m an extrovert and it would’ve made me so happy to see friends every day and I pray to God I’ll one day have close friends I can see every day. I ended up feeling forced to go to church just to even be around other kids. I’m so tired of living my life on the internet.

There is no good schooling option. It’s a matter of which one your child wants, because they’re the one going to it. It takes listening to your kids and giving them options based on their needs, a rare trait in parenting. I don’t like woke ideology but I’m very scared for the future because I see people just jumping to a opposite extreme. Oh your child is being bullied? Be sure and bring them home to be bullied by their family instead. Oh they have no friends at school? Be sure and bring them home, they’ll make great friends with people on Discord. Or maybe just play online games and at least have the illusion of friendship. Or maybe just swing a sword around by themselves outside for an hour.

I love how consistently we correctly reference how the rich gimp education. Typically the rich being conservative, anti labor,  anti intellectualists. But when it comes time to call out rich conservatives who are actively lowering the working age and preserving underage marriages, you stay silent

Then we mention things like book banning in schools but ignore that it's conservatives who have been and are primarily responsible...

You mention a single school having a drag event but do literally nothing to show how this in anyway hurt education.  You just say ""a school did this, it hurt education""

When u talk about the elites getting into schools you don't discuss anything pertinent. No SAT scores, GPA, community work, etc. And you hilariously highlight only left leaning individuals and ignore the boatloads of right leaning ones who do the same

As someone who is currently experiencing public school in a conservative state within the U.S., I have seen this narrative first hand. I was aware of the political brainwash in my schools pretty much since the beginning of my highschool years, and looking back I see it was always present, most notably the pledge of allegiance, which i've only recently found strange, along with many other things such as any mentions of the United States doing evil (in which they have done countless times throughout history) are practically non-existent, even the mentions of the slave trade being brief, the slave trade itself sugar coated with nicknames such as ""the triangular trade"", however when watching this video it opened my eyes to exactly how much school is brainwashing us as a society as a whole, whether the narrative be ""liberal"" or conservative, which has naturally lead me to believe that authoritarianism in general is harmful to our society, the mentality pushed upon us in schools directly disproving the statement ""capitalism breeds innovation"". I believe this issue is inherently political and that as long as close minded people in our society swallow propaganda that our schools feed them, we're going to have authoritarian groups barking at each other on how their authoritarianism is better than the other kind. What point exactly am I trying to get across? Just don't be a sheep, don't be an authoritarian, embrace true liberty, rather than the false liberty the U.S. and by extension most capitalist countries (or any authoritarian government) claim to give us.

I'm not saying that teacher was right in any way to go off on children like that. But it is a non-sequitur to what you're saying there. 

Also a bit earlier you mention billionaires controlling the education system as a means of controlling information. Yet then seem to claim Google as a source of free information. Google.. Owned by some of the richest and most powerful people in the world. I know there are of course nuances to this. And of course the Chinese state is a hell of a lot more restrictive than Google or the other major tech giants. And it can be argued that whereas the old industrialist tycoons benefitted from factory worker drones with a strong focus on conformity, the modern tech giants benefit from a more educated populace that are stimulated to be more creative in certain areas. 
The point is, both do the same thing. Control information. 
China still has a more classic manufacturing based economy. Hence they benefit from high levels of conformity. The west now has moved away from that type of economy, and so requires a different kind of education. Hence corporations like Google control information in a way that facilitates this need.",UCR_4LFv3ZRAVkWlGZ4H63TA,Ugx9XHOP81KkU0OzL9h4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=Ugx9XHOP81KkU0OzL9h4AaABAg

When I physically fought back I was always the one in the wrong. I was just told to ignore it, which is a bad suggestion for someone with poor impulse control. I could tell them to stop, but they would just parrot it back in a mocking tone of voice

So when those classmates and some others ganged up on me one lunchbreak evening, I somehow managed to scratch a kid from the other class on the side of their neck. I still don't remember how, so I was surprised when one of the other teachers stormed up in the middle of class, furious, because I injured one of their pupils. Luckily, the parent didn't press charges, it was a light scratch. But that could just be my brain doing its thing

And with that incident over, I was just told to wait on the side for all other students to enter (the school or a classroom) so it doesn't happen again. I was just cast aside. 

Years later, in middleschool (highschool? the system here is different from the american one), when our professor gave us a project, it was a theme I couldn't think about without breaking down.

2250,,tomurg,"2023-11-02 18:43:59",0,no,no,"The title of this video and of course the video itself really hit me hard after having endured disillusionment from the modern school system. 

About 5 years ago now I started out on a college education called Travel & Hospitality. I had hopes and dreams of becoming a successful tour-guide. During my first year I was very successful. I passed nearly every test with good grades and all. My biggest accomplishment was when I indeed became a tour-guide and organizer for an excursion with the students to Italy in November 2019. I handed out all the boarding passes at the airport, found the way to the hotel and told many things at the historical sights. I still regard it as one of the proudest accomplishments of my life. 

It was shortly after that excursion that I would get into a downward spiral of declining succes. I failed an important test as a result of which, among many other external factors, I wasn’t allowed to do the follow up education I wanted. There were 2 directions you could go from there. One of them was Aviation which really enticed me because it seemed to me a good way to cultivate experience on many areas of the Travel Industry. The other was called manager Traveling which was the one I was forced to do and which mainly involved working from behind your computer on developing your own travel agency with all the difficult theory and quite frankly had very little to do with traveling itself. I was the only one of my previous class who (forcibly) went for that education. I was discouraged from doing aviation by multiple teachers who all said I wasn’t good enough for it and even falsely accused me of having said that I thought aviation would be boring. Eventually even my parent made the argument I wouldn’t be able to find an internship place because covid messed up the travel industry a lot back then.

Eventually I failed that manager traveling eduction, because it just wasn’t my thing and I had a really hard time with going to school during the whole covid pandemic with one day being at school and one day having online class. After that I spend months at home feeling like a complete failure because of all that happened. I had grown very disillusioned after all that happened and all the vigor and energy I had when I started out on that education, almost 3 years before, was completely gone.

But a lot more than all what I just described went on there behind closed doors. The education of Travel & Hospitality was mainly focused on working from behind a desk at a travel agency or doing something in the aviation, while there are a LOT more possibilities within the traveling industry. I admit to being rather open about my ambition of becoming a tour-guide which I’m hindsight seemed to be my big mistake. I’ve never conducted myself disorderly throughout my whole time at the education. But my “crime” in their eyes was thinking differently. Not wanting to waste away behind some desk all the days of my life. Like I already mentioned being somewhat ambitious, and I don’t see why that’s a problem. Seems to me you need people on an education who are a bit ambitious and put all their heart and soul into it. But as this video clearly states, school doesn’t exist to help you fulfill your hopes and dreams but to mold and brainwash you to be a productive member of the society, another face in the crowd. And anyone who doesn’t fit all the expectations is simply shoved aside as I experienced. Don’t get me wrong, your hopes and dreams can be achieved by being clever and proper maneuvering through all te backdoor politics. I’ve learned that colleges van be real Machiavellian organizations. But even after all that has been done to me, I shall always strive to still achieve what I set out for.",UCoWL4u754g7habU6tiE9Kqw,UgyWFYSDigJUIFUxw7h4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AZbROlOdk&lc=UgyWFYSDigJUIFUxw7h4AaABAg

I also feel like that you kind of brought it back with studies of how favoritism with the rich, but you then go back to talk about how ""wokeness"" is ruining academics.

But instead focus on how politcal thoughts and self expression are the true things that are wrong in the system which is hypocritic of what you said in the beginning.
